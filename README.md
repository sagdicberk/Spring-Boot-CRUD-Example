This project is a demonstration of the concepts and skills I acquired during Engin DemiroÄŸ's BootCamp. Throughout this BootCamp, we delved deep into the fundamentals of Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful API development, which are all implemented in this project.

Project Overview
 -> The primary objective of this project is to showcase the implementation of basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Spring Boot. It features a well-structured RESTful API that interacts with a PostgreSQL database, which is a popular choice for production-level applications due to its robustness and advanced features.

Key Features
-> Spring Boot Framework: Utilized for building a stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based application with minimal configuration.
-> PostgreSQL Database: The application uses PostgreSQL as its database management system, offering reliability and performance for managing relational data.
-> RESTful API: The project provides RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD operations efficiently.
-> Comprehensive Documentation: Each class within the project includes detailed notes and explanations related to the BootCamp lessons. These notes are intended to serve as a learning aid for others who might work on or review this project.
